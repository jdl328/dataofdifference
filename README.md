# Welcome to The Data of Difference: A History of Personal Data
Welcome to the _Data of Difference/ The Difference of Data,_ a digital exhibition on the history of personal data by Jason Ludwig. The visual essays in this collection aim to explore the place of personal data in twentieth-century American history and politics by addressing two questions:

-_Which classification systems have government agencies used to sort and order Americans and their data?_ 

-_How have these classification systems changed in accordance with shifts in science, technology, and institutional imperatives?_

This work has been supported by a [Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities sponsored by Cornell University Library & Society for the Humanities](https://blogs.cornell.edu/sgfdh/). The visual essays in this collection were created using Juncture, an open-source tool for digital humanities scholarship developed by JSTOR Labs. More information can be found on the [Juncture web site](https://juncture-digital.org) and in the online [User guide](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/juncture/wiki).
